Placing !default at the end of a variable declaration will have the following effect:

If the variable already has an assignment, it will not be re-assigned
Variables with null value will be considered unassigned and will be assigned with !default

example:

	$color: blue;
	$color: green !default;

	in this case, $color will be blue, because it has value, but if the variable was null, the variable would be green because of the !default falg;
